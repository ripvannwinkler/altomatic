# Altomatic

Altomatic is an FFXI alt bot inspired by the hard work of atom0s and Daniel Hazzard over at [Cure Please](https://github.com/DanielHazzard/Cure-Please). It offers mostly the same features as Cure Please, but with a simplified UI. I originally attempted to fork the original project and apply any fixes I found necessary, but it eventually became too cumbersome to work with the legacy code base.

## Credits

This project would not exist without the hard work and dedication of the fine people from the [EliteMMO network](http://www.elitemmonetwork.com/) and the [Ashita project](https://www.ashitaxi.com/). We proudly stand on the shoulders of giants to make this possible.
